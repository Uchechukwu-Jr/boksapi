But after she returns to Boolavogue to continue her training with Gaius and the Hunters, she begins to doubt if she is even worthy of such a grand title after a real Hero visits the Kingdom. After all, Heroes are always confident, rippled with muscles, and gallant with smiles even in the face of fear. They especially don’t have nightmares on a weekly basis or fear talking with their own peers… right?I couldn’t even defeat Darkness without Gaius’ help, so how could I ever save a life, a town, or even a country all on my own? I can’t even win a spar against the brawny Keeper of Stars!As the yearly Paragon Games returns, grabbing the attention of every magical heart on Planet Kalm, something else is stirring underneath the pageantry of the magical sport. These gladiator games are meant for fun, but as Lisa becomes more invested in the battles and players, she lets curiosity take control of her actions and begins to unravel secrets that risk more than her life.A new fire burns inside Lisa, and now, it doesn’t matter if she is good enough to become Hero. She has to be, or the Agaped Magic will be lost forever.",
